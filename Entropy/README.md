# Entropy - The low poly game
Entropy is a game made with Unity which focuses on RPG with a procedurally generated world.
The game is focused on the story of the main character(you) and his/her endeavors into the magical world where the line between science and magic is blurred.
Unfortunately, something unknown is slowly destroying our world and it doesn't seem to be stopping.
You will embark on a journey through places you have never imaged in hope that you will be the one to stop the world as we know it from disappearing completely into chaos.
During your journey, you will encounter as many enemies as people wanting to help you. 

Keep in mind that the game is nowhere done or even started :D
